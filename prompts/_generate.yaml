task: Generate initial unit tests for the given C++ file

input:
  language: C++
  description: >
    You are given a C++ file from a real-world project. Your job is to
    write initial unit tests using Google Test. The tests should cover
    the core logic, class methods, and edge cases where possible.

output:
  format: >
    One or more properly formatted unit test files using the Google Test framework.
    The test file should:
      - Include necessary headers (e.g., gtest/gtest.h and the C++ file under test)
      - Avoid duplicate test cases
      - Focus on correctness and meaningful scenarios
      - Be self-contained and ready to compile

constraints:
  - Do NOT duplicate test logic
  - Do NOT generate test cases for getter/setter-only methods unless they have logic
  - Only include `#include` statements that are actually needed
  - Use descriptive test names (e.g., `TestClass_Method_Condition`)
  - Place all test cases in a test namespace
  - The output file should be named `test_<filename>.cpp`

notes:
  - These are first-pass tests, so coverage doesn't have to be exhaustive.
  - Aim for meaningful branch/path testing.
