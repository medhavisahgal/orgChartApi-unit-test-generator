task: Refine and improve the generated unit tests for a given C++ file.

input:
  language: C++
  description: >
    You are given a unit test file written using Google Test.
    Your task is to improve the quality, formatting, and correctness of these tests.

output:
  format: >
    A single clean unit test file that:
      - Includes only the necessary headers
      - Uses descriptive and consistent naming
      - Follows Google Test best practices
      - Removes duplicate or redundant test cases
      - Fixes any incorrect or failing logic
      - Ensures every test has meaningful assertions

constraints:
  - Do NOT introduce any duplicate test cases
  - Do NOT test trivial getters/setters unless they contain logic
  - Use only necessary includes
  - Format with consistent indentation and spacing
  - Prefix all test cases with `TEST` macros
  - Use `EXPECT_`/`ASSERT_` macros appropriately

notes:
  - If the test file is missing includes or test setup, add them
  - The file should be self-contained and ready to compile with g++
